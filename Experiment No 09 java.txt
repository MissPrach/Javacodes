Aim: Program on Java script client side scripting.
Objectives: To be able to design more interactive and faster web application using client side
scripting language.
Theory:
Client-side scripting, like JavaScript, can be embedded into the page on the client’s
browser. This script will allow the client’s browser to alleviate some of the burden on your web
server when running a web application. Client-side scripting is source code that is executed on
the client’s browser instead of the web-server, and allows for the creation of faster and more
responsive web applications.
Client-side scripting (embedded scripts) is code that exists inside the client’s HTML
page. This code will be processed on the client machine and the HTML page will NOT perform a
PostBack to the web-server. Traditionally, client-side scripting is used for page navigation, data
validation and formatting. The language used in this scripting is JavaScript. JavaScript is
compatible and is able to run on any internet browser.
The two main benefits of client-side scripting are:
1. The user’s actions will result in an immediate response because they don’t require a trip to the
server.
2. Fewer resources are used and needed on the web-server.
Javascript:
JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by
several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming
language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. It
was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator
browser. Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript,
users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every
time. The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity.
JavaScript is used to create interactive websites. It is mainly used for:
 Client-side validation,
 Dynamic drop-down menus,

 Displaying date and time,
 Displaying pop-up windows and dialog boxes (like an alert dialog box, confirm
dialog box and prompt dialog box),
 Displaying clocks etc.
Source Code:
<html>
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">
function msg(){
alert("Hello");
}
</script>
</head>
<body>
<p>Welcome to Javascript</p>
<form>
<input type="button" value="click" onclick="msg()"/>
</form>
</body>
</html>
Output:
