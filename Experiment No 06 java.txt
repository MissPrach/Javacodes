Aim: Write a Java program that illustrates the following
i) Creation of simple package.
ii) Accessing a package.
Objectives: To understand the mechanism to encapsulate a group of classes, sub packages and
interfaces and how to access them.
Theory:
A package in Java is used to group related classes. Think of it as a folder in a file
directory. We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code.
Packages are divided into two categories:
 Built-in Packages (packages from the Java API)
 User-defined Packages (create your own packages)
Built-in Packages:
The Java API is a library of prewritten classes, that are free to use, included in the Java
Development Environment.The library contains components for managing input, database
programming, and much more. The library is divided into packages and classes. Meaning you
can either import a single class (along with its methods and attributes), or a whole package that
contain all the classes that belong to the specified package.
To use a class or a package from the library, you need to use the import keyword:
Syntax :
import package.name.Class; // Import a single class
import package.name.*; // Import the whole package
Import a Class If you find a class you want to use, for example, the Scanner class, which
is used to get user input, write the following code: Example import java.util.Scanner; In the
example above, java.util is a package, while Scanner is a class of the java.util package.


User-defined Packages:
To create your own package, you need to understand that Java uses a file system
directory to store them. Just like folders on your computer:
Example
└── root
└── mypack
└── MyPackageClass.java
To create a package, use the package keyword:
MyPackageClass.java
package mypack;
class MyPackageClass {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("This is my package!");
}
}
Source Code:
i) Program on creation of simple package

package MyPackage;
public class Compare {
int num1, num2;
public Compare(int n, int m) {
num1 = n;
num2 = m;
}
public void getmax(){


if ( num1 > num2 ) {
System.out.println("Maximum value of two numbers is " + num1);
}
else {
System.out.println("Maximum value of two numbers is " + num2);
}
}
public static void main(String args[]) {
Compare current[] = new Compare[3];
current[1] = new Compare(5, 10);
current[2] = new Compare(123, 120);
for(int i=1; i < 3 ; i++)
{
current[i].getmax();
}
}
}
Output:
Maximum value of two numbers is 10
Maximum value of two numbers is 123
ii) Program on accesing a package

package Ncer;
import MyPackage.Compare;
public class Demo{
public static void main(String args[]) {
int n=10, m=10;
Compare current = new Compare(n, m);
if(n != m) {
current.getmax();
}



else {
System.out.println("Both the values are same");
}
}
}
Output:
1
Both the values are same
