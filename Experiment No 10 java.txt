Aim: Programs on Java script Operators, Comparisons, Statements, Loops, Events.
Objectives: To be able to design more interactive and faster web application using JavaScript.
Theory:
JavaScript operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands
Types of JavaScript Operators
There are different types of JavaScript operators:
 Arithmetic Operators
 Assignment Operators
 Comparison Operators
 Logical Operators
 Conditional Operators
 Type Operators
JavaScript Arithmetic Operators:


JavaScript Comparison Operators:

JavaScript Bitwise Operators:

JavaScript Logical Operators:


JavaScript Assignment Operators:

JavaScript Statements:
The programming instructions written in a program in a programming language are
known as statements.
Order of execution of Statements is the same as they are written.
 Semicolons:
 Code Blocks
 White Space
 Line Length and Line Breaks:
 Keywords
JavaScript Loops
The JavaScript loops are used to iterate the piece of code using for, while, do while or
for-in loops. It makes the code compact. It is mostly used in array.
There are four types of loops in JavaScript.
1. for loop
2. while loop
3. do-while loop
4. for-in loop


JavaScript Events
The change in the state of an object is known as an Event. In html, there are various
events which represents that some activity is performed by the user or by the browser.
When JavaScript code is included in HTML, js react over these events and allow the execution.
This process of reacting over the events is called Event Handling. Thus, js handles the HTML
events via Event Handlers
Mouse events:

Form events:

Window/Document events

iii) Program on Operators
<html>
<body>
<script type = "text/javascript">
var a = 33;
var b = 10;
var c = "Test";
var linebreak = "<br />";
document.write("a + b = ");
result = a + b;
document.write(result);
document.write(linebreak);
document.write("a - b = ");
result = a - b;
document.write(result);
document.write(linebreak);
document.write("a / b = ");
result = a / b;
document.write(result);
document.write(linebreak);
document.write("a % b = ");
result = a % b;
document.write(result);
document.write(linebreak);
</script>
Set the variables to different values and then try...
</body>
</html>



Output:
a + b = 43
a - b = 23
a / b = 3.3
a % b = 3
Set the variables to different values and then try...

iv) Program on Comparison Operators

<html>
<body>
<script type = "text/javascript">
var a = 10;
var b = 20;
var linebreak = "<br />";
document.write("(a == b) => ");
result = (a == b);
document.write(result);
document.write(linebreak);
document.write("(a < b) => ");
result = (a < b);
document.write(result);
document.write(linebreak);
document.write("(a > b) => ");
result = (a > b);
document.write(result);
document.write(linebreak);
document.write("(a != b) => ");
result = (a != b);
document.write(result);
document.write(linebreak);
document.write("(a >= b) => ");
result = (a >= b);
document.write(result);
document.write(linebreak);



document.write("(a <= b) => ");
result = (a <= b);
document.write(result);
document.write(linebreak);
</script>
</body>
</html>

Output:

(a == b) => false
(a < b) => true
(a > b) => false
(a != b) => true
(a >= b) => false
(a <= b) => true

v) Program on Events

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h2>JavaScript HTML Events</h2>
<p>Click "Try it" to execute the displayDate() function.</p>
<button id="myBtn">Try it</button>
<p id="demo"></p>



<script>
document.getElementById("myBtn").onclick = displayDate;
function displayDate() {
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = Date();
}
</script>
</body>
</html>

Output:
Click "Try it" to execute the displayDate() function.
Try it

vi) Program on loops
<html>
<body>
<script type = "text/javascript">
<!--
var count;
document.write("Starting Loop" + "<br />");
for(count = 0; count < 10; count++) {



document.write("Current Count : " + count );
document.write("<br />");
}
document.write("Loop stopped!");
//-->
</script>
</body>
</html>

Output:
Starting Loop
Current Count : 0
Current Count : 1
Current Count : 2
Current Count : 3
Current Count : 4
Current Count : 5
Current Count : 6
Current Count : 7
Current Count : 8
Current Count : 9
Loop stopped!
